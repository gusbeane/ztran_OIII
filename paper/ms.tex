% Abstract of the paper
\begin{abstract}
The early stages of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), probed by the 21~cm line,
are sensitive to the detailed formation of the first galaxies. An important
transition occurs on large scales at $\avg{x_i}\sim0.15$, when the 21~cm field
transitions from being positively correlated with the galaxy field to being
negatively correlated. The redshift at which this transition occurs (the
``transition redshift'') is, in principle, sensitive to both the structure of
the 21~cm field but also the galaxy field. However, by considering a fixed
model for the EoR and varying the parameters of a simple model for the galaxy
field in a mock [O~\textsc{iii}]-emitter sample cross-correlation, we show
that the transition redshift is in fact insensitive to the structure of the
selected galaxy sample. We show that prospects for measuring the transition
redshift are feasible in the near-term with a combination of LOFAR and JWST.
Being derived from a cross-correlation, the transition redshift is less
impacted by foreground contamination currently inhibiting 21~cm auto-spectrum
measurements. Therefore, the transition redshift is a promising probe of the
early stages of the EoR.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% BODY OF PAPER %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Introduction}
The redshifted 21~cm line contains a great deal of information about the
structure and evolution of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Once measured at
$z\sim6\textup{--}12$, it should reveal the nature of the formation of the
first stars, galaxies, and black holes, as well as the large-scale structure
of the Universe at high redshift \citep{2013fgu..book.....L}. While
instruments have reached the sensitivity necessary to detect the signal during
the EoR, issues of foreground contamination and instrumental artifacts have so
far prevented the success of such efforts. Only upper limits have been placed
on the amplitude of the 21~cm fluctuations \citep[e.g.][]{2013MNRAS.433..639P,
2014PhRvD..89b3002D, 2016ApJ...833..102B, 2017ApJ...838...65P}.
